Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your
next webpage?! You’re disgusting. When other websites give you text, they’re not
sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots
of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing
mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume,
are good words.
